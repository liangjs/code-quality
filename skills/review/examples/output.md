1. **[Shallow Module]** AuthHandler interface mirrors implementation — `src/auth/handler.py:AuthHandler`
   AuthHandler exposes 8 methods that mostly delegate to internal calls
   with minimal transformation. The interface is almost as complex as
   the implementation.
   **Suggestion:** This class handles both session validation and token refresh. Merging
   these into a single `authenticate()` that handles the full lifecycle
   internally would hide the multi-step process from callers.

2. **[Information Leakage]** DB error codes exposed in API responses — `src/api/response.py:format_error`
   Internal database error codes are exposed directly in the API response.
   Callers now depend on DB-specific error structures.
   **Suggestion:** Introduce an app-level error type in the API layer so that switching
   from Postgres to another store won't ripple through all API consumers.

No significant quality issues. The new CacheManager class provides
a clean deep interface — simple to use, hides TTL and eviction logic well.
