Build a Claude Code skill (`/review-code-quality`) that evaluates code quality for long-term maintainability.

## Book Reference

The book is available at `book/`. Chapters are in `book/chapters/`.

## Skill Design

## Implementation Notes

- Read book chapters selectively as needed during implementation, do NOT read the full book upfront.
